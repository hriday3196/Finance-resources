**Hi, this is Hriday (2021A8PS3187H).** Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to chat.

Over the past few years, multiple people have approached me regarding resources to start their financial journey. While I don't have a finance minor, I do have a decent-sized portfolio with about three years of investing experience. This repository contains resources that will help you get started with the basics of finance, particularly investing, so you won't feel left out in conversations.

## Mutual Funds

If you don’t have the time and energy to analyze individual stocks, mutual funds are a great way to invest your money for the long term. You can start with as little as ₹1,000 per month (after an initial investment of ₹3,000 or ₹5,000) or go as high as ₹3 lakhs per month—believe me, I know people who do this!

### Basic Definitions

- **Mutual Fund (MF):**  
  A Mutual Fund pools money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets like stocks, bonds, or other securities. Professional fund managers handle the investments according to the fund’s objectives.

- **Why Invest in a Mutual Fund:**  
  Mutual funds offer diversification, professional management, and convenience. They allow investors to access a wide range of assets without managing individual investments. You can start with small amounts and gradually increase your investment.

- **Systematic Investment Plan (SIP):**  
  SIP is a method of investing in mutual funds where you contribute a fixed amount at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, etc.). SIPs encourage disciplined investing, rupee cost averaging, and benefit from compounding over time.

- **How to Select a Mutual Fund:**  
  Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, fund performance, expense ratio, and the reputation of the fund manager. Compare funds within the same category and assess their consistency in returns.

### Types of Mutual Funds

- **Debt Funds:**  
  Invest primarily in fixed-income securities like bonds and government securities. These are suitable for conservative investors seeking steady income.

- **Equity Funds:**  
  Invest primarily in stocks. These carry higher risk but offer the potential for higher returns, suitable for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance.

- **Net Asset Value (NAV):**  
  NAV is the per-unit price of a mutual fund. It’s calculated by dividing the total value of the fund’s assets minus liabilities by the number of outstanding units. NAV fluctuates daily based on market conditions.

## Miconceptions & Other questions(I'll keep expanding this as people ask questions)
### 1. What if I lose all my money
   Ans: suppose you invest 5000 in a largecap stock(something like reliance, tcs, etc), a super stable stock with decent historical returns etc etc, even in the case of a market crash, the most you'd lose is 10%, 20% if a world war starts, which is a maximum of 1000, but again, thats worst worst case so we'll take 500 as an average. With all due respect to however you spend your money, you can probably forego eating out once to do this, theres a higher chance you make 500 than you lose 500, and feel free to call me for a drink when you do so!

### 2. What are all these other things apart from stocks such as commodities, forex etc etc
   Ans: commodities is where you trade literal commodities like crude oil, gold, silver etc etc, it has the advantage of having a much higher participation from investors but that also means its super volatile, one big news can wipe out a decent chunk of your net worth. I would recommend venturing into these areas once you're decently profitable in the equity market. The analysis of gold is super interesting based on stock market and news trends, check it out here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1K_FOe7Z9I

   
### 3. What is quant and whats the hype around it
   Ans: Quant finance is High Frequency trading. It involves strategizing, writing code to execute trades on your behalf, servers and well, mainly, a shit ton of money.  you're aiming to capture 0.1-0.2 rupee differences in the span of milliseconds. You can refer to this github to know what you should know in this field. You can always reach out to your seniors on linkedin for knowing how to enter this field. Do note that mostly CS 9+ are taken from top 5 IITs and Pilani Campus(1-2 hires for every company, so you gotta be at the top of your field). The hype? you also earn a shit ton of money lol.

**Hi, this is Hriday (2021A8PS3187H).** Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or want to chat.

Over the past few years, multiple people have approached me regarding resources to start their financial journey. While I don't have a finance minor, I do have a decent-sized portfolio with about three years of investing experience. This repository contains resources that will help you get started with the basics of finance, particularly investing, so you won't feel left out in conversations.

## Mutual Funds

If you don’t have the time and energy to analyze individual stocks, mutual funds are a great way to invest your money for the long term. You can start with as little as ₹1,000 per month (after an initial investment of ₹3,000 or ₹5,000) or go as high as ₹3 lakhs per month—believe me, I know people who do this!

### Basic Definitions

- **Mutual Fund (MF):**  
  A Mutual Fund pools money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of assets like stocks, bonds, or other securities. Professional fund managers handle the investments according to the fund’s objectives.

- **Why Invest in a Mutual Fund:**  
  Mutual funds offer diversification, professional management, and convenience. They allow investors to access a wide range of assets without managing individual investments. You can start with small amounts and gradually increase your investment.

- **Systematic Investment Plan (SIP):**  
  SIP is a method of investing in mutual funds where you contribute a fixed amount at regular intervals (monthly, quarterly, etc.). SIPs encourage disciplined investing, rupee cost averaging, and benefit from compounding over time.

- **How to Select a Mutual Fund:**  
  Consider your financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, fund performance, expense ratio, and the reputation of the fund manager. Compare funds within the same category and assess their consistency in returns.

### Types of Mutual Funds

- **Debt Funds:**  
  Invest primarily in fixed-income securities like bonds and government securities. These are suitable for conservative investors seeking steady income.

- **Equity Funds:**  
  Invest primarily in stocks. These carry higher risk but offer the potential for higher returns, suitable for long-term investors with a higher risk tolerance.

- **Net Asset Value (NAV):**  
  NAV is the per-unit price of a mutual fund. It’s calculated by dividing the total value of the fund’s assets minus liabilities by the number of outstanding units. NAV fluctuates daily based on market conditions.
